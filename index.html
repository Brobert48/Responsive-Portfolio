        <p>My name is Blake Robert. I was born in London, Ontario, Canada. I have a passion for problem solving and figuring out the internal workings of devices. From an early age I began to explore computer code, and modifying existing programs. Unfourtunatly, life got in the way of that passion and I am only now truely begining to dive into the world of web development. And so far, I LOVE it!<p>
        <p>Working with code has really allowed me to satisfy my need to problem solve. As this program continues I hope to narrow down my focus area in the field of web development. This way, when I graduate, I can hit the ground running with expanding my expertise in that area. </p>
        <p>More to come....</p>
